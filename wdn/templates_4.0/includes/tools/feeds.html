        <h3>What is <span class="rss-icon">RSS</span> ?</h3>
        <p>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is an open-standard XML format used to publish frequently updated works such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, and video. You can subscribe to these feeds by using a news reader program. The application connects to the news services at preset intervals and downloads new items as they are published. <a title="Learn more about RSS" href="http://www1.unl.edu/feeds/about.php">Learn More&hellip;</a>
