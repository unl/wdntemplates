              <p>Primary headers are set in Hoefler &amp; Co.&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/tungsten/overview/">Tungsten</a>.</p>
              <p>While they default to Tungsten&rsquo;s Semibold (600) weight, they can also be set in the Book (400) weight by adding the <code>wdn-brand</code> class to the header tag. In fact, a little Tungsten Semibold goes a long way. Consider using <code>wdn-brand</code> for most headers and reserving Tungsten Semibold for the most important sections on your page.</p>
