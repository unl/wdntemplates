# UNL WDN Templates

The template files are developed and maintained by the [Web Developer Network] (http://wdn.unl.edu/) (WDN) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln] (http://www.unl.edu/). These templates are made up of HTML, CSS and JS to power the underlying web presence.

## Template Usage

Template usage is subject to the [WDN Terms of Use] (http://www1.unl.edu/wdn/wiki/Terms_of_Use).

### Templates Available

All templates variations utilize the same HTML markup, with an exception of the body class, ex: `class="document"`.

## Collaboration

All members of the WDN are invited to contribute to this project. Please make a fork of the [main repository] (https://github.com/unl/wdntemplates) for local development. Once you have created and tested your code, please send a pull request to the main repository.

## Further support

Support of the UNL Templates is coordinated and communicated through the [WDN] (http://wdn.unl.edu/).
