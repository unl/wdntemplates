00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:14,290
my husband is, um ... well, he's required to speak publicly.

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,570
I have received ...

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,630
th ...

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,360
echh ....

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,720
Perhaps you should change jobs.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,050
And what if my husband were the king?

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,550
(music)
My husband has seen everyone.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:32,470
Insert them into your mouth.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,350
(muffled speech)

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,930
Enunciate!

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,480
He hasn't seen me.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:37,080
What was your earliest memory?

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,940
I can cure your husband, but I need total trust.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,520
(agitated) I'm not here to discuss personal matters.

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,570
Why are you here then?

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,940
(shouting) Because I bloody well stammer!

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,490
Do you know any jokes?

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,990
Timing isn't my strong suit.

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,330
Your methods are unorthodox and controversial.

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,000
And up comes your royal highness ...

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:02:24,199
It's actually quite good fun.
